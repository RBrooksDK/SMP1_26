### Session Description

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The key elements of linear regression include the dependent variable, independent variable(s), regression coefficients, intercept, and residual error. The regression coefficients represent the change in the dependent variable associated with a one-unit change in the independent variable, while the intercept represents the expected value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are equal to zero. The residual error is the difference between the observed values of the dependent variable and the values predicted by the regression model. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line that minimizes the sum of the squared residual errors. Linear regression is a widely used method in various fields to make predictions or estimate the strength and direction of relationships between variables.

#### Key Concepts
- Least Squares Estimates
- Regression Equation
- Correlation
- Coefficient of determination
- Prediction
- Residual Analysis

I've added a [page](Calculating_metrics.md) with all the useful formulas for calculating the parameters as well as the performance metrics, $r$ and $r^2$

#### Exercise 1 (2020.4)

Hydrocarbon emissions from cars are known to have decreased dramatically during the 2010s. A study was conducted to compare the hydrocarbon emissions at idling speed, in parts per million (ppm), for automobiles from 2010 and 2020. Fifty cars of each model year were randomly selected, and their hydrocarbon emission levels were recorded. The data is displayed in "HydroCarbonEmissions.xlsx".

1. Determine estimates for the quartiles, average emission, standard deviation and variance of each model year.
2. Setup $95 \%$ confidence intervals for the mean of each model year, and accompany the intervals with plots that display the rejection region
3. Is it reasonable to assume that the emission of each model year is normally distributed? Explain using plots and discussing skewness and kurtosis.
4. Setup a $99 \%$ confidence interval for the mean emission difference between the two model years and accompany the intervals with plots that display the rejection region.
5. Is there significant evidence to support the claim that the mean emission difference between the two model years differ from one another?

#### Exercise 6 (Reexam 2018.5)

Data collected in 1960 from the National Cancer Institute provides the per capita numbers of cigarettes sold along with death rates for various forms of cancer (see [Smoking and Cancer.xlsx](SmokingandCancer.xlsx)).

1. Build regression models with cigarettes sold as the independent variable and each of the four cancer types as the dependent variable. Accompany each model with a scatterplot and a trend line as well as confidence intervals for the regression parameters.
2. For each model, inspect the residuals to confirm that the assumptions about normality and non-patterns are met.
3. Which of the four cancer types exhibit the best correlation with cigarettes sold? Assess using the correlation coefficient.
4. In which data pairs is cigarettes sold a good predictor for the type of cancer? Assess using the correlation of determination and interpret the meaning of this number.
5. For the model that has the best correlation, find the predicted value of deaths per 100 k for 40 and 50 cigarettes sold per capita. Feel free to include $95 \%$ prediction intervals to your predictions.

#### Exercise 7 (Reexam 2018.6)

The dataset for this assignment is the infamous Titanic data set (please see [Titanic.xlsx](Titanic.xlsx)). The objective is to determine whether the survival rates differ between selected variables.

Variable notes:

- pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status
- 1st $=$ Upper
- 2nd $=$ Middle
- 3rd $=$ Lower
- age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5
- sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
- Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
- Spouse $=$ husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored)
- parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
    - Parent $=$ mother, father
    - Child $=$ daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
    - Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
- alone: is a variable that was created from combining sibsp and parch.

<br>

1. Create a contingency table, placing survived on the vertical axis and pclass on the horizontal axis.
2. Test whether survival rate is independent of pclass.

#### Exercise 8 (2018.6)

The data in [Salary.xlsx](Salary.xlsx) show the (monthly) salary along with years of experience of 31 software developers.

1. Create a complete regression analysis of the data mentioned above. Your analysis must include a plot of the data, considerations about outliers, estimates for the regression parameters and confidence intervals for these, considerations about the assumptions of the model, as well as an assessment of the adequacy of the model.
2. According to the model, what salary can a newly graduated software developer with no experience expect?
3. Assuming the developer starts his/her career at 27 and retires when he/she is 67 , what will be the salary of the developer when he/she retires? Does this sound plausible?

#### Exercise 10 (2017.5)

A recent study among 254 computer science graduates from Aarhus University was made in order to determine how successful the former students were in their current employment. 98 of these students had taken a course in linear algebra and of these 92 were classified as "successful" in their current employment. 136 of the students who had not taken a course in linear algebra were classified as "successful" in their current employment.

1. Is the evidence to support the claim that computer science graduates who had taken a linear algebra course were more successful in their current employment than those who had not taken such a course?
2. Explain the meaning of the p-value obtained in question (a), i.e. what does this probability refer to?

#### Exercise 11 (2017.6)

As part of their final project, two ICT students are working on a data warehouse support system. The major workload is the warehouse orders. Thus, the key business metric is identified as number of order lines. The students want to find a method to predict CPU utilization based on the number of order lines entered into the system and have collected 31 samples of CPU utilization and number of order line entries
